## Real-world Problem

Our idea is creating a program to be used at hospitals to handle new patients coming in.
We will determine the order that patients can be seen and collect data on these patients.
Priority queue will be used to determine a queue depending on the urgency of care needed for walk-ins.
Radix sort will be used to sort the patients by name.
Bucket sort will be the helper sorting method used in conjunction with radix sort.
Interval trees will be used to check for any overlapping times for appointments.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (at least 3)

1. Interval trees
2. Radix sort
3. Bucket sort
4. Priority queue
